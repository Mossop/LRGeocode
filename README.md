LRGeocode
===========

This is a plugin for Lightroom 4 to look up GPS information for photos. It
uses the Sublocation/City/State/Country metadata fields to create an address
and then sends that to a geocoding API to get possible GPS locations. If more
than one is returned it asks the user which one is the best match.
